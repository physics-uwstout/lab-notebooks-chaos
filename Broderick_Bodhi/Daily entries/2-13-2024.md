Today myself and 3 others gave presentations to introduce our projects. The other 3 were 2D Fluid Flow, Single Photon Detection, and Brownian Motion

After that at around 8:45, we moved to the lab to continue experimenting with the chaotic oscillator.

Nick brought in a raspberry pi to see if we can run the python code to the oscillator directly without the use of a laptop so that in future we can leave in running without leaving our laptops in the lab.

We had some confusion with the different iterations of ai and human code, but eventually we got a code block working that graphs rotation over time, as well as a measure of how many data points are added per second, 32.

I also worked on getting a graph of angle in radians vs angular velocity phase space.
