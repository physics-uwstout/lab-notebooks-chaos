Today, we saw 5 presentations then went to the lab. We don't have 439 class after this class b/c Dr. Zimmerman has a prior engagement. 

In lab, we looked at our latest batch of data with a frequency of 0.79. The data has several outliers as shown below:

I spent some lab time making my table of contents and writing small summaries of each day.

Then Nick worked on the code to fix the concatenation error likely causing the outliers, and meanwhile I experimented with creating a Poincare section of some of our data.
