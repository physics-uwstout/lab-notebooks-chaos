Today, we were assigned experiments and groupmates, I got the chaotic systems experiment with Nick. We spent the first hour and a half working on two assignments about reading research papers, one where we read it ourselves and answered questions and another where we made an ai do it and critiqued the ai.

After that, we took a tour of the lab. Nick and I took out the mechanical oscillators and started reading the pdf files. We grabbed 2 power supplies and hooked up the oscillator to usb with PuTTY to send it commands. we had to attach the ground wire, after doing that it worked first try!
