Today only one of the four 139 speakers showed up so we watched his presentation and gave feedback, then we went to the lab. Unfortunately Dr. Zimmerman is sick so he left soon after.
Nick and I looked at the data from the run between tuesday and today and found interestingly that there were some huge outliers in the position values, ocassionally jumping from around 10^3 range numbers to 10^9 for just one data point then back to 10^3. In order to examine the data graph, we simply set limits

Here is the first 30 minutes, with the outliers shown:

we got some decent data fixed from the tu-th data but not from the past weekends data. I tried to get the graph to animate so we could view the change over time but that didn't work.
