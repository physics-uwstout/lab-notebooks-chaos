Today began with 4 more project presentations by 439 students, then we spent about 45 minutes working on using Github to sync our obsidian notebooks.

At 9:30, Nick and I moved to the lab to continue work with the MCO. The code for expanding the bounds if the encoder rod spins in one direction more than the other is working very well, and we also started looking at damping the flywheel with the micrometer.

f=0.77 ampl=500 -> more spinning cw than ccw from above


Nick worked on using his raspberry pi to upload the code to the MCO teensey board so that we can leave it overnight to run without leaving a laptop in the lab.

He was able to find the correct serial port to connect the teensy to the pi and send python to the MCO successfully. We also discussed making adjustments to the data output of degrees so they are accurate to real life.
