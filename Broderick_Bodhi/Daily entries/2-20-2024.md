Nick gave his presentation and did a good job, during the questions after Dr. Zimmerman told us we only have to focus on the MCO or the double pendulum not necessarily both.

Returning to the lab, we found a data file containing 354 mb of data, which was a good sign that the collection had been working since last thursday the 15th. 


19,058,188 data points were collected from Thursday 5:00pm to today at 8:40am

That's 4840 minutes so we were collecting data at 65.63 times per second. Also in the data the amount of time that seems to pass per data point is a little over 0.02 seconds which means around 50 data points per second which is pretty close.

I had to install notepad++ to view the data effectively because excel and notepad both couldn't handle that quantity of data.

Nick and I are now discussing what we can do with this data and how we can change the collection code to collect better time values. 

Nick adjusted the code so it collected data around 90 times per second.

For some reason, the time values stop at 3501 and jump to -793 repeatedly

Also, the code nick is working on with the pi is not adjusting bounds as we expect where it goes from -2000 to 2000

This graph shows in blue the values we were getting and in orange the correct values we are now getting when the encoder is spinning in one direction for the first 4ish seconds:
