Create a folder in this folder with a name "Lastname_Firstname".  Inside that create a note titled "Lastname Firstname Table of Contents".  All of your lab notebook material should be stored in this subfolder and linked to in your table of contents.

Your folder should have a subfolder for PDFs (articles), another subfolder for Data Files, a third subfolder for Jupyter Notebooks, and a fourth subfolder for Misc Files.  You can see an example of how things are structured in same folder as the example student file, [[Broderick Bodhi Table of Contents]]
