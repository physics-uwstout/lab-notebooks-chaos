- Added recieve_comm():
	- Reads response and separates responses by '\n'
	- Discards all responses not of the form:
		- "{int} {int} {float}"
	- Reads the position from all formatted responses
	- Returns most consistent value
- Dynamic Bounding
	- 2048 to -2047
	- Changed bound into int so there is a larger range of values
	- Created constant DELTA = 4096
		- 2048++
			- device reads -2047
				- want 2049
			- device + DELTA * bound
				- 2049
		- -2047--
			- device reads 2048
				- want -2048
			- device + DELTA * bound (bound is -1)
				- -2048
- Port Finding
	- lsusb
		- Identify CO at Bus & Device
		- Write down vid and pid 
			- "vid:pid"
		- Use python to identify serial port
- CO still broken
	- Broken Transistor or Resister?
	- Shorting ground and negative?
