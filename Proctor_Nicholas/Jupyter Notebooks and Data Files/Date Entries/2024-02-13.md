- Chaotic Ossilator
	- Dynamic bounding
		- Errors
			- Running multiple versions at the same time
			- Continual climb
				- Code needed to add bound to the read position before acting
			- Potential Bounding Error with rapid rotation
				-  Only occurs if $\frac{d\theta}{dt}\Delta t > 3500$
	- Angle vs Angular velocity Graph
		- need to confine to radians and bound $[0, 2pi]$
	- 36 datapoints/s
		- why => need more precise control
	- RPI setup
		- run for HDMI - HDMI-mini
		- paired keyboard and mouse
